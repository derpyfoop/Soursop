	 tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.  It is popular for its delicious flavor and impressive health benefits.</p>
	 
	 <p>It’s also very nutrient-dense and provides a good amount of fiber and vitamin C for <br/>
	 very few calories. nThis prickly green fruit has a creamy texture and a strong flavor <br/>
	 that is often compared to pineapple or strawberry.</p>
	 
	 <p>Soursop is typically eaten raw by cutting the fruit in half and scooping out the flesh. <br/>
	 Fruits range in size and can be quite large, so it may be best to divide it into a few <br/>
	 portions.</p>
	 
	 <p>A typical serving of this fruit is low in calories yet high in several nutrients like fiber <br/>
	 and vitamin C. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of raw soursop contains: </p>

	<h2>Health benefits for soursop</h2>

	
	<ol class = "olist">
		<li><h3>It's High in Antioxidant</h3>
		<p>Many of the reported benefits of soursop are due to its high content of antioxidants. </p>
					
		<p>Antioxidants are compounds that help neutralize harmful compounds called free <br/>
		radicals, which can cause damage to cells.</p></li>
		
		<li><h3>It May Help Kill Cancer Cells</h3>
		<p>Although most research is currently limited to test-tube studies, some studies have <br/>
		found that soursop could potentially help eliminate cancer cells. </p>
		
		<p>One test-tube study treated breast cancer cells with soursop extract. Interestingly <br/>
		enough, it was able to reduce tumor size, kill off cancer cells and enhance the activity <br/>
		of the immune system.</p></li>
		
		<li><h3>It Can Help Fight Bacteria</h3>
		<p>In addition to its antioxidant properties, some studies show that soursop may contain <br/>
		potent antibacterial properties as well.</p>
		
		<p>In one test-tube study, extracts of soursop with varying concentrations were used on <br/>
		different types of bacteria known to cause oral diseases.</p>
		
		<p>Soursop was able to effectively kill off multiple types of bacteria, including strains <br/>
		that cause gingivitis, tooth decay and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/yeast-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20378999" target="_blank">yeast infections</a></p></li>
		
		<li><h3>It Could Reduce Inflammation</h3>
		<p>Some animal studies have found that soursop and its components may be able to <br/>
		help <a href="https://www.scripps.org/news_items/4232-six-keys-to-reducing-inflammation" target="_blank">fight inflammation</a></p>
		
		<p>Inflammation is a normal immune response to injury, but increasing evidence shows <br/>
		that chronic inflammation could contribute to disease In one study, rats were treated <br/>
		with soursop extract, which was found to decrease swelling and alleviate <br/>
		inflammation.</p></li>
		
		<li><h3>It May Stabilize Blood Sugar Levels</h3>
		<p>Soursop has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels in some animal studies.</p>
		
		<p>In one study, diabetic rats were injected with soursop extract for two weeks. Those <br/>
		who received the extract had blood sugar levels that were five times lower than the <br/>
		untreated group.</p></li>

	<h2>How to Eat Soursop</h2>

	<p>From juices to ice creams and sorbets, soursop is a popular ingredient found <br/>
	throughout South America and can be enjoyed in a variety of different ways. </p>

	<p>The flesh can be added to smoothies, made into teas or even used to help sweeten <br/>
	baked goods. However, because it has a strong, naturally sweet flavor, soursop is most <br/>
	often enjoyed raw. When selecting fruit, pick one that is soft or let it ripen for a few <br/>
	days before eating. Then simply cut it lengthwise, scoop out the flesh from the rind <br/>
	and enjoy.</p>

	<p><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
	Keep in mind that the seeds of the soursop should be avoided, as they have been <br/>
	shown to contain annonacin, a neurotoxin that may contribute to the development <br/>
	of Parkinson's disease.</span></p>

	<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

	<p>Test-tube and animal studies using soursop extract have uncovered some promising <br/>
	results regarding this fruit’s potential health benefits. </p>

	<p>Still, it’s important to remember that these studies are looking at the effects of a <br/>
	concentrated dose of soursop extract, much greater than the amount you would get <br>
	from a single serving.</p>

	<p>However, soursop is delicious, versatile and can be a beneficial addition to your diet. <br/>
